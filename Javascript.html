<h2 class="test2">Javascript Used Throughout Website</h2>
<p class= "area">On the "Book for a Cause" page, I created a function called "validate" (lesson 10: Forms & Form Validation) that keeps the form from being submitted until all the inputs have been filled. Once filled and submitted, an alert pops up to thank the visitor for booking with Pup Huts. You can view this at: <a href="Book.html">Book For A Cause</a>.</p>
<br>
<p class= "area"> On the "Cabin with a pup" page, I created a "double click" event (lesson 9: Events) to the text "Double Click For A Coupon Code And Save 20% On A Pup Hut". By double clicking this text a coupon with a description of how to apply it will appear. You can view this at: <a href="Cabins.html">Cabin With A Pup</a>.</p>
<br>
<p class= "area">On the "Contact Us" page, I created a slideshow (lesson 11: jQuery) to display some of the dogs that have recently been adopted through "Pup Huts". You can view this at: <a href="Contact.html">Contact Us</a></p>
<br>
<p class= "area"> On all Pup Hut pages, I created a function (lesson 4: Functions) to display the last date the website was modified on. This is located on the bottom of every page. You can view this starting on the "Home" page at: <a href="index.html">Home</a></p>
<br>
<p class= "area">On the "Cabin with a pup" page, I used "querySelector" (lesson 8: Document Object Model (DOM)) in order to create a "mouseover" event once a visitor places their mouse over the table, located at the bottom of the page. The table will zoom in and be more legible for the visitors. You can view this at: <a href="Cabins.html">Cabin With A Pup</a>.</p>
