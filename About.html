<h2 class="test2"> About Pup Huts</h2>
<p class="area"> We are a unique lodging business located outside Helena, Montana. Pup Huts is one of a kind because we not only provide our visitors with a cozy, cabin getaway experience, but we also achieve our mission of providing aid for dogs in need.</p>
<br>
<p class="area"> Pup Huts' goal is to provide forever homes for rescue dogs and shine a light on animal adoptions. Through our unique lodging business, we give individuals the experience to enjoy how it feels living with a rescue dog. Each rental cabin is the home to a rescue dog in need. Therefore, if you book with us, you are not only receiving an amazing getaway experience but are also bringing love and companionship to these dogs in need. And because we love making a positive impact on as many lives as we can, we will also be donating 5% of every reservation made with us to our local animal shelters.</p>
